###

Omitting research is like sailing with no direction. A proper user research is going to be the foundations of your product.

You can use the following methods of user research:

- **Focus groups:** Moderated discussion between 5 - 10 participants. You'll learn what they believe, think, desire, and how they react to concepts.
- **Surveys:** Well studied questionnaire for your target audience.
- **Interviews:** Individual talk with the user from 30 min to an hour. You'll learn what they believe, think, desire, and how they react to concepts.
- **Usability testing:** Your target audience will evaluate your product or service by testing it.
- **Task analysis:** Learn about ordinary users actions by observing them performing some tasks. Helps identify features your website must have.
- **Personas:** It's the collection of needs and scenarios from representative users, curated for the team to help in design decisions.

With the information you gathered from the define stage and the research lets analyze and polish the most important elements of our product.

In my case, I did a mix of surveys, task analysis and personas with analytics insights.

| Characteristics      | Answer                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Age                  | 23 - 35                                                |
| Gender               | Any                                                    |
| Education background | current student, bachelor's degree, self-taught        |
| Purchasing power     | $3,000 ‚Äì $6,000 monthly income                         |
| Social class         | Medium-Low                                             |

| Consumption habits   | books, courses, masterclasses, web tools and trainings |

Depending on what your target audience is, is time to transform that information into user personas. These personas are profiles of your ideal customer.

They will help to answer:

- Goals
- Needs
- Background
- Behaviors
- Age
- Gender
- Pain points
- Spending habits

Now that the user personas are defined, you need to know how they are going to interact with our product. This is crucial and will help you to understand each of the steps the user will follow and how will it feel.

Mapping these actions generates the following information:

- Build empathy
- Reveal opportunities
- Break down silos
- Bring focus
- Provide a common ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù

These are the pillars for a product to be successfully designed and developed. You must never skip this stage otherwise you could be building a product for the wrong audience and then fail.
